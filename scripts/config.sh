# Deliberately small. Everything the Xcode build needed -- scheme, bundle id,
# deployment target, derived-data paths, signing identity -- left with the
# original macOS app. The Tauri build reads its own values from
# `app/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, which is the single source for the bundle's
# identity; duplicating any of it here is how the two drift.

# Version is NOT configured here (org Versioning spec §3/§10: no hand-maintained
# version fields). Both numbers derive from git via their single-source scripts:
#   marketing version → scripts/get-version-info.sh   (CalVer YYYY.M.<commits-this-month>)
#   build number      → scripts/get-build-number.sh   (total commit count, monotonic)

#
# The Apple team id is deliberately NOT stored in this repository. It arrives
# from the environment instead: `.envrc.local` locally, `secrets.*` in a release
# workflow.
#
# It is not a secret either: a team id ships in the signature of every binary
# Apple distributes. Unset is a warning, never a wall — a contributor must
# still be able to build.
